TODO: Add description

## Code Workflow

1. Authenticate the client
2. Detect faces in an image
3. Find similar faces
4. Create and train a person group
5. Identify a face
6. Verify faces

## 01. Single Face Detection

This program will only identify one face from the image no matter how many faces exist in the photo.

## 02. Multiple Face Detection

This program will identify all faces from the image.

## 03. Face Recognition

This program will identify a face from an image. Then it'll be able to identify that face from a group of faces.
